## Overview

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base where I document technical concepts, tools, and insights encountered during software development. Each entry represents a discrete learning moment, organized by topic and date.

The format follows the "Today I Learned" (TIL) pattern popularized in the developer community, where short, focused notes capture specific knowledge rather than comprehensive tutorials. This approach creates a searchable reference library that grows organically over time.

Entries cover a wide range of topics including programming languages, frameworks, system design, development tools, and best practices. The repository functions as both a personal reference and a public resource for others learning similar technologies.
